Connection recovery differs by deployment mode. Avoid clearing all dashboard data before checking
the provider and address.

## Check the visible error

Common causes include:

- An unreachable provider address.
- A LAN, VPN, Tailscale, or external Home Assistant authorization route that is unavailable from
  the current browser during sign-in.
- DNS, firewall, or CORS restrictions.
- HTTP and HTTPS mismatch.
- An expired browser-specific session.
- A standalone container that cannot reach the configured upstream.

## Reconnect from Settings

1. Open **Settings → System**.
2. Review **Connection** and **Providers**.
3. Confirm the provider address.
4. Choose **Connect** or repeat the supported sign-in flow.

Do not use a manual long-lived-token flow for Home Assistant.

## Sign in at home or through a VPN

Standalone Navet keeps the browser-facing Home Assistant address separate from its trusted
upstream. This lets the same installation open Home Assistant through a LAN address at home and a
VPN, Tailscale, or external address while away.

1. From the device that is signing in, confirm that you can open Home Assistant directly at the
   address you plan to use.
2. Enter that same address in Navet.
3. Choose **Continue** and finish the Home Assistant sign-in.

Navet uses the address entered in the login form for both the authorization page and the token
exchange. That address must be reachable from your browser and from Navet. If `NAVET_HASS_URL`
is explicitly configured, Navet uses it for the token exchange and API traffic; the browser address
must reach that same Home Assistant installation.

### Read the Home Assistant return error

- **Navet could not reach Home Assistant to finish sign-in** means Navet could not contact the token
  endpoint. Check the address from the Navet host or container.
- **Home Assistant rejected the sign-in code** means the token endpoint rejected the exchange.
  Start a fresh sign-in. If `NAVET_HASS_URL` is configured, confirm that it and the browser address
  reach the same installation.
- **Home Assistant returned an invalid sign-in response** means the response was incomplete or
  malformed. Start a fresh sign-in rather than reusing the old return URL.

### Change the Home Assistant address

Enter the replacement address in Navet and sign in with Home Assistant. If `NAVET_HASS_URL` is set in Compose, update that configuration and recreate the container
when the upstream address changes. Remembered addresses do not override the login form.

## Stuck on Starting your dashboard

An existing standalone session should renew through Navet even when the browser cannot reach Home
Assistant's LAN address.

1. Reload Navet once to activate the current application version.
2. Confirm that the VPN route to Navet is still active.
3. Confirm from the Docker host that the Navet container can reach its trusted Home Assistant
   upstream.
4. If a recovery action appears, choose **Retry connection** for a temporary outage. Choose
   **Back to login** when the saved Home Assistant session cannot be restored and you need to sign
   in again.

## Deployment-specific checks

- Home Assistant Ingress should reuse the parent Home Assistant session.
- Standalone Docker needs a browser-reachable Home Assistant address while authorization is open
  and a trusted upstream reachable from the Navet container. They may be different routes to the
  same Home Assistant installation; routine dashboard use and token renewal use the latter through
  Navet's same-origin proxy.
- openHAB must be reachable from the Navet container and accept the configured credentials.
- Homey OAuth requires the configured client and callback route.

## Reset only the affected connection

Use **Reset connection** or **Disconnect** for the affected provider, then reconnect. Signing out
ends the Navet session on the current device; it does not delete provider devices.

## Report safely

Include the Navet version, installation mode, provider, failing address hostname, HTTP status, and
exact visible error. Remove tokens, cookies, passwords, and signed URLs.
