Export a local configuration backup before a large layout change or before importing another
configuration.

![Local config backup with Export config and Import config.](/docs/how-to/dashboards/backup-controls.webp)

## Export a backup

1. Open **Settings → Dashboard**.
2. Find **Local config backup**.
3. Choose **Export config**.
4. Store the downloaded file somewhere you control.

The export contains dashboard configuration. It is not a backup of your smart-home provider.

## Import a backup

1. Return to **Local config backup**.
2. Choose **Import config**.
3. Select a Navet `.yaml` or `.yml` configuration export.
4. A valid file is applied immediately after selection. Wait for the success message and dashboard
   refresh; there is no separate review confirmation.

Import can replace current local configuration. Export the current state first if you may want it
back.

The startup wizard also offers **Import a config file**. It restores configuration directly instead
of continuing through the language and appearance steps. Standalone Navet refreshes afterward;
the Home Assistant custom panel reveals the imported dashboard in place.
