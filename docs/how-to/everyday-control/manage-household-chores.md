Use **Chores** to manage recurring work and **Progress** to review activity. Open
**Household → Settings** to protect or back up your household. Use **Today** to complete daily work.

## Edit, pause, or archive a chore

1. Open **Household → Chores**.
2. Search by name or filter by room, person, schedule, or status.
3. Choose **Edit** on the chore card.
4. Use the sidebar steps **The chore**, **Who does it**, and **When it repeats** to update the
   work, assignment, and schedule. On a small screen, the steps appear across the top. Choose
   **Next** and **Back**, or select a step directly; your edits stay in place as you move between
   them. The **More options** section below each step's main fields holds instructions, points,
   approval, missed-work behavior, or reminders. The card colour can be changed in the chore
   preview.
5. On **When it repeats**, choose **Save changes**.

Each chore has a consistent automatic colour unless someone overrides it. Overdue red and
completed green take priority over the custom colour.

On **Who does it**, choose a standby for a person's chore or choose **Fewest assigned or completed chores**
for rotation. **More options** can set a later due date for each person, open claiming shortly
before the scheduled start, wait for an earlier claim's approval, and keep a claim when work is
sent back. On **When it repeats**, choose **Hourly interval** for an elapsed-hour repeat or
**After completion** to keep the chosen clock time a set number of days after finished work.

Open the card's **More actions** menu, then choose **Pause** to stop creating new occurrences while
keeping the chore and its history. Choose **Archive** when the definition should leave the active
library; archived chores can be restored later. Deleting a chore stops future reminders but
preserves completed history.

## Plan a person's time away

1. Open **Household → Settings → People** and choose **Edit** for the person.
2. Turn on **Paused** and optionally choose **Resume on**. Chores assigned to a standby can still
   be done while the primary person is away.
3. If the person has a return date, choose **Review due dates** in People. Select unfinished work
   from the absence and choose **First new due date**. Navet previews the number of selected chores
   and moves them one per day after the return.

Paused work does not create overdue reminders. Existing claims remain available for manager
review. Long-cycle chores appear in the review list but are not preselected.

## Review progress

1. Open **Progress**.
2. Choose the last 7 or 30 days.
3. Filter to one person when you need their activity only.
4. Review completed and missed work, the upcoming week, and the workload note.
5. Export CSV or JSON when you need a copy of the filtered history.

Choose **Weekly report** in Progress to review the current week. Select Markdown or HTML, then
copy the report to share it. The report includes completed and missed work, pending approvals,
and the next week's schedule.

In the Home Assistant panel, `navet.weekly_report` returns the same kind of report to an
automation. For scheduled delivery, set a weekly time trigger, call `navet.weekly_report` with
`format: markdown` and a `response_variable`, then pass that variable's `content` to your
notification action. The calendar entity **Navet chores** lists upcoming due work for calendar
automations. Home Assistant also provides typed `navet.reward_decision` and
`navet.adjust_points` actions for Home Assistant administrators and system automations.
Give point adjustments a stable `command_id` so a retried
automation cannot apply the same change twice.

Each chore's notification settings can select which claim, completion, approval, and missed-work
events send alerts. Today shows current alerts with the actions available to their recipient.
On Home Assistant mobile notifications, the action buttons apply to the exact chore revision
that produced the alert; an older button has no effect after the chore changes.

To set a badge or personal achievement, choose **Add badge** or **Add achievement** in Progress.
Choose what to measure and a target number. Select chores when the goal should count only those
chores, choose whether it runs once, every week, or every month, and optionally add award points.
A personal achievement also needs a person. The cards show each person's current progress and
earned awards. A missed due day breaks a due-day streak; days with no scheduled work, including a
pause, leave it unchanged.

## Manage missions and rewards

In **Household → Settings → Motivation style**, choose **Light points**, **Family goals**, or
**Child-friendly adventure** to show the **Missions** and **Rewards** tabs. Open either tab to create
and edit supporting goals. After you create at least one mission or enabled reward goal, **See rewards**
appears in Chores today. Choose it to reveal the current mission and reward cards for that visit.
Choosing **Off** hides these surfaces and preserves their saved goals and household history.

To use a reward, open **Rewards**, choose the person under **Request reward for**, and select
**Request reward** on a goal. The person needs enough points for its cost. The request holds the
reward's current name and cost, while their point balance stays available until review.

A household manager reviews requests in **Rewards**. **Approve** spends the points once;
**Decline** leaves the balance alone. After approval, **Mark fulfilled** records that the reward
was delivered. **Refund points** returns the approved cost if the reward cannot be given. The
request status and point decisions stay in the household record even if the goal is edited.

## Hide household chores

Chores are enabled by default. To hide the feature, open **Settings → Dashboard**, find
**Household chores**, and choose **Off**. Navet removes the Household chores workspace, Home and
room chore pills. Your chore definitions and history stay saved, so choosing
**On** later restores the feature with its existing data.

## Protect management changes

Open **Settings** and configure a management PIN when a shared wall screen should allow completion
but not planning changes. The PIN protects people, definitions, motivation, retention, restore, and
reset actions. It is a household-screen boundary, not an account password, and it is not included
in chores backups. To replace it later, open **Household → Settings → Management PIN**, choose
**Change PIN**, and confirm the new 4–8 digit PIN. Navet asks for the current PIN first whenever
management is locked.

## Restore a backup during first setup

You can restore a Navet chores backup from the welcome screen of a new installation.

1. Open **Household**.
2. On the welcome screen, choose **Import backup**.
3. Select the saved Navet chores JSON file.
4. Review the confirmation and choose **Import backup**.

Navet validates the backup before replacing the empty workspace. The backup must contain an active
household manager. A completed backup opens the restored household directly; an incomplete backup
returns to the appropriate setup state.

## Download a backup

1. Open **Household → Settings**.
2. Choose **Data and recovery**.
3. Choose **Download backup**.
4. Store the downloaded `navet.chores` file somewhere protected.

![Chore settings open to Data and recovery with Download backup, Import backup, and Reset chores controls.](/docs/how-to/everyday-control/household-data-recovery.webp)

## Restore a backup

1. In **Data and recovery**, choose **Import backup**.
2. Select a Navet chores backup, a supported Home Assistant todo export, or a normalized ChoreOps
   export.
3. Choose **Merge** to keep current chores and remap conflicts, or **Replace** to remove the current
   workspace first.
4. Review the confirmation before restoring.

Download a fresh backup before using **Replace** if the current household may be needed later.

## Recover damaged chore data

If Navet cannot read the current workspace, it leaves the saved file unchanged and shows **Chores
need attention**.

1. Choose **Try again** after checking that the installation storage is writable.
2. Choose **Repair chores** when a healthy last-known-good copy is available.
3. Use **Start over** only when neither copy can be recovered and the existing data is no longer
   needed.

Starting over requires explicit confirmation and preserves the damaged primary file for diagnosis
before an empty workspace is created.
