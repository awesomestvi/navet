Navet connects to your smart-home providers and brings their supported devices and features into
one dashboard.

## Available providers

- [Home Assistant](/install/home-assistant/) is the reference adapter and supports the custom panel,
  add-on, and standalone deployment routes.
- [Homey](/install/homey/) uses the standalone cloud OAuth flow. A Home Assistant add-on can also
  connect Homey as an additional provider when its Homey client options are configured.
- [openHAB](/install/openhab/) uses the base-URL and credential flow. It can also be connected as an
  additional provider from Settings in a running multi-provider installation.

Follow the [roadmap](/roadmap/) for planned providers.

## Capability Matrix

This table shows the features available through each provider. Individual controls also depend
on the capabilities of your devices.

| Capability | Home Assistant | Homey | openHAB |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Rooms, realtime state, lighting, switches, and sensors | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Lock state and lock/unlock controls | Yes | Writable lock capabilities | Supported lock items |
| Cover position and movement controls | Yes | Writable position, open/close, and supported stop commands | Position and movement for supported cover items |
| Climate dashboard services | Yes | Target temperature and operating modes | Target setpoint |
| Media playback and volume controls | Yes | Writable speaker capabilities | Playback and volume for supported items |
| Media browse, search, artwork, and grouping | Yes | No | No |
| Camera snapshots and live streams | Yes | No | No |
| Energy configuration and statistics | Yes | No | No |
| Entity sensor history | Yes | Insights logs | No |
| Calendar and weather data | Yes | No | No |
| Notifications | Yes | Read and hide locally | No |
| Updates and restart actions | Yes | No | No |
| Runnable scenes, Flows, and Moods | Yes | Yes | No |
| Household presence | Yes | View people | No |
| Automation/task details and triggering | Yes | No | No |
| Shared to-do and shopping list items | Yes | No | No |
| Assist text, microphone, and response audio | Yes | No | No |
| Provider room and entity administration | Yes | No | No |

`No` means the feature is unavailable through that provider in Navet. The platform may support
it in its own interface.

### Home Assistant

Navet maps Home Assistant rooms and realtime entities for lights, switches, sensors, climate,
media players, cameras, energy, calendars, weather, notifications, updates, Assist pipelines, and
supported task or automation surfaces. Home Assistant also provides the advanced dashboard and administration
services marked **Yes** in the matrix above.

Supported household helpers include numeric values, dropdown options, text, and dates or times.
Native `datetime` values display and save in UTC, with the zone shown on the control. Date/time helpers retain their Home Assistant wall-clock semantics.
Their controls follow the entity's available options and limits. Configuration-category entities
retain their existing metric presentation. Boolean and button helpers keep their existing controls.

Room names and entity assignments refresh after external Home Assistant registry edits and after
reconnection. A failed metadata refresh retains the last loaded rooms and entities. These features
use the existing authenticated connection in standalone, Ingress, and custom panel installations.

Climate dialogs offer thermostat presets, climate fan modes, vertical and horizontal swing,
and target humidity when the owning device advertises them. These controls use the climate
device's options and limits; separate fans and humidifiers keep their existing controls.

The Tasks workspace keeps Home Assistant lists separate from routines and Navet chores. Select
**Lists** to view a connected source's shopping or to-do items. Supported lists allow adding,
completing or reopening, editing, and removing items. Description and due-date fields appear only
when that list supports them. Shared item updates refresh without relying on the incomplete-item
count changing. See Home Assistant's [to-do list documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/todo/)
for the backend's list behavior.

### Homey

Navet maps Homey rooms, lights, switches, fans, sensors, locks, covers, thermostats, speakers, people, and
notifications. Locks show their current state and support lock/unlock through writable capabilities.
Cover cards show available position readings and offer writable percentage or movement controls;
stop depends on the device's capabilities, and tilt is unavailable.
Thermostats support target temperature and available operating modes; speaker
controls follow writable playback, volume, mute, and track capabilities. Runnable Flows,
Advanced Flows, and Moods are available as shared scene cards. People appear in presence cards,
and matching Insights logs provide entity history for the last 31 days. Availability depends on
Homey's version and granted permissions. See the capability matrix above for supported features.

### openHAB

Navet maps openHAB rooms and realtime items for lights, switches, fans, climate setpoints, speaker
playback and volume, locks, covers, security sensors, batteries, and utility measurements. It does
not register history, energy-statistics, alarm-panel, media-browser, camera, calendar, weather,
notification, Assist, task, or provider-administration services.

### Planned providers

Hubitat and SmartThings have catalog metadata only. They are not available as
runtime providers yet.

## Multiple Providers

Navet can store more than one implemented provider session in runtimes that expose provider
management. In **Settings → System** you can connect or disconnect providers. Shared features use
the entities you select and route commands to each entity's owning provider. Canonical,
provider-scoped IDs keep entities from different platforms
distinct when their native IDs match.
