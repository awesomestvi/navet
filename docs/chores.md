Household chores keeps recurring home work in the same calm, shared interface as the rest of
Navet. The **Today** view answers four questions first: what needs doing, who should do it, when it
is due, and whether it is finished.

![Household Today with the one-row Chores today, overdue and upcoming chore cards, assignees, time, points, and the See rewards action.](/docs/how-to/everyday-control/household-today.webp)

Chores belong to your Navet installation, not the connected smart-home provider. Navet stores
people, assignments, schedules, and history in a shared household workspace. Changing a provider
connection does not create a new household, and separate Navet installations keep separate data.

## Where chores are available

Chores require shared storage supplied by the Navet runtime. Standalone Docker supplies this
storage for supported provider connections. In Home Assistant, it is supplied by the Navet
add-on or the Navet custom integration used by the custom panel.

Provider capabilities still determine whether optional reminders, routine actions, or projected
entities are available. See the [integration reference](/integrations/) for provider support.

## The Household workspace

- **Today** puts overdue and due work before later chores. **Chores today** shows earned points,
  streak, completion, and a **See rewards** action.
- **Chores** is the searchable library for creating, editing, pausing, duplicating, and archiving
  recurring work.
- **Missions** and **Rewards** appear when a motivation style is enabled and manage optional shared
  goals without changing the underlying chore workflow. Their supporting cards stay out of Today
  until **See rewards** is opened.
- **Progress** shows contributions and a weekly review.
- **Settings** manages people, motivation style, backups, restore, and recovery.
- **Routines** keeps provider automations, scenes, and scripts available beside native chores.

Chores are enabled by default. **Settings → Dashboard → Household chores** can hide or restore the
feature, its Home summary, and room chore surfaces without deleting chore definitions or history.

Room dashboards show a Chores summary pill in a single scrollable row. Choose the Chores pill on
Home or in a room to open the Household dashboard and complete chores. The pill remains available with the dashboard summary
hidden and keeps the same row height as chores are assigned or completed. Device cards retain their
chosen order.

## Reading a chore card

The card header keeps the room and timing state above the chore title. Time and points sit together
at the top right; optional instructions use the middle; the assignee and the smaller secondary
**Mark done** action stay in the footer. Overdue work uses a red border and status treatment.
Completed work remains visible in a smaller card with a green earned-points badge and no time tag.

Each active chore has a consistent automatic colour. Choose **Edit → Card color** to override it.
Completed and overdue state colours always take priority over that override.

## People and shared screens

A person in Household is a lightweight workflow profile. Profiles make assignment, completion,
approval, reminders, and activity understandable, but selecting a person from **Using this screen**
is not an account sign-in.

Every household keeps at least one manager. Managers can change people and chore definitions,
approve work, manage data, and optionally protect those changes with a management PIN. Ordinary
completion actions remain available on a shared screen after a PIN is configured.

## Assignment and schedules

A chore can belong to one person, be open to anyone, create one occurrence for everyone, or rotate
between selected people. A person's chore can name a standby who covers scheduled work while
the primary person is away. Rotation can follow a fixed order or choose the person with the fewest
assigned or completed turns. Schedules support one-time, daily, weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, monthly,
hourly-interval, and after-completion recurrence. Calendar schedules and completion-date repeats
keep the chosen local time; hourly intervals count elapsed hours through daylight-saving changes.
For after-completion schedules, marking a chore done sets its next date from the day it was
completed. A 14-day interval completed on 4 October is next due on 18 October, even when the chore
was completed early. Each person can have a later due date for their turn.

Optional approval separates “marked done” from final completion. Missed-work rules can skip an
occurrence, carry it forward, or leave it visible for review. Pausing a chore stops new occurrences
without deleting completed history.

A claim can open only near the scheduled start, wait for an earlier turn's approval, and stay with
the claimant when work is sent back. A paused person can have a return date. Work scheduled during
their absence stays out of overdue and reminder processing. In **Settings → People**, managers can
review unfinished due dates from that absence and move selected work to consecutive days after
the return. Claimed work stays available for review.

## Motivation is optional

Core chores work with motivation turned off. **Light points**, **Family goals**, and
**Child-friendly adventure** add progressively more feedback while keeping assignments and
completion history unchanged. Missions and rewards are supporting surfaces, not prerequisites for
using Today. Choose **Household → Settings → Motivation style**, then **Light points**,
**Family goals**, or **Child-friendly adventure** to show Missions and Rewards. **Off** hides those
surfaces while retaining their saved goals and household history.

Progress cards open an individual points view with the person's current balance and point history.
Balances may be negative when points have been reversed or removed. Household managers can add or
remove points with an optional note after unlocking management; every adjustment remains in the
person’s immutable history.

In **Progress**, managers can add recurring badges for the household or a personal achievement for
one person. A target can count selected chore completions, all completions, points earned, days with
completed work, or a streak of completed due days. Targets can run once, weekly, or monthly and may
award points. Awards appear beside each person's progress and remain in point history.

In **Rewards**, a person can request an enabled reward once they have enough points. A request
leaves the balance unchanged. A household manager reviews requests there: **Approve** spends the
points, **Decline** keeps the balance, **Mark fulfilled** records delivery, and **Refund points**
returns the approved cost. Each request remains visible with its status, including after the reward
goal is edited or removed.

## Data, history, and recovery

Chore changes are shared across authenticated Navet screens connected to the same installation.
Revision checks prevent one screen from silently overwriting a newer household change. Activity
history supports weekly review and JSON or CSV export.
Progress offers a shareable weekly report in Markdown or HTML. In the Home Assistant panel,
automations can request the report, act on reward requests, adjust points with a stable command
ID, and use the Navet chores calendar to see upcoming due work.

Access to the installation and chore management are separate: screens must be authenticated,
while household roles and the optional management PIN govern planning and recovery actions.

Use **Settings → Data and recovery** to download a complete backup. Restoring with **Merge** keeps
the current workspace and remaps conflicts; **Replace** removes the current workspace before the
backup is restored. A damaged workspace keeps its saved file unchanged while Navet offers retry,
last-known-good recovery, and an explicit start-over path.
