# Navet Docs

Use this page as the map for the documentation set.

## Keep guidance matched to the product

Follow [documentation policy and drift audit](agents/documentation.md). Verify product/tutorial/
marketing claims against current owners and supported provider/deployment behavior; inspect the
actual product or story where needed. A preset demo is not a connected-installation workflow.

## Document lifecycle

Current guides describe lasting behavior; open roadmaps describe unshipped scope. Remove shipped
items and completed plans after capturing durable contracts. History belongs in changelogs,
issues, PRs and Git. Existing Markdown, screenshots and plans are evidence to verify.

## Start Here

- If you want to run Navet: start with the provider setup guides.
- If you want to contribute code: start with [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- If you need maintainer or release guidance: jump to the maintainer section below.
- For AI tasks: start with [root AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) and its single routed guide.

## Repo Map

Use [root ownership routing](../AGENTS.md#product-and-ownership). Search the owner and direct
callers; there is no root `src/`. `apps/docs/src/content.config.ts` selects public Markdown.
[Shared UI layers](design-system/README.md#current-shared-ui-layers) distinguish current app-owned
paths and stable imports from the incremental `@navet/ui` target.
